Whenever you run an app on your computer, its function (high level program) is converted to its respective assembly language program using a compiler. It is then converted into machine level code using an assembler. Finally, this machine code (also known as a bitstream) is fed into the chip layout, which will perform its function accordingly.

This project aims to design a RISC V microprocessor core and understand its various functions. We will start with a simple c program then look into its assembly and machine language code. Before that, let us see some basic commands we need to know to implement this in a Linux based system.
